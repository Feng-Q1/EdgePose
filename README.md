EdgePose: An Edge Attention Network for 6D Pose Estimation

We propose a 6D pose estimation method that introduces edge attention mechanism into 1
the bidirectional feature fusion network. Our method constructs an end-to-end network model by 2
sharing weights between the edge detection encoder and the encoder of the RGB branch in the feature 3
fusion network, effectively utilizing edge information and improving the accuracy and robustness of 4
6D pose estimation.

The code will be ready soon.
