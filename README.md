EdgePose: An Edge Attention Network for 6D Pose Estimation

We propose a 6D pose estimation method that introduces edge attention mechanism into the bidirectional feature fusion network. Our method constructs an end-to-end network model by sharing weights between the edge detection encoder and the encoder of the RGB branch in the feature fusion network, effectively utilizing edge information and improving the accuracy and robustness of 6D pose estimation.

The code will be ready around Oct.

Stay tuned.
